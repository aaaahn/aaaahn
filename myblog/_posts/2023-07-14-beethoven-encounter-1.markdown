Early life - firs to do piano well - interesting that was able to inflen new thing, respect the 
Mentored by hadn’t. String quartets, like other composers before, scared to reinvent stuff, op 18, razumofsky think its interesting how the music of his time, no one able to realize the brilliance,  how things that pale in comaprison to music of today Ould seem so emotionally charged and creative to that day, 
Beethoven symphony 3- 

Historical context fascinating, hailed as new Mozart, how timeliness cross, love to see intersections between the thoughts of enlightenment thinkers and ideals and the composers of the time, enjoyed learning about Kant’s idea of music as the purest form of happiness, thing we must strive to do, how beethoven internalized that, mad emus ic. Thing to strive towards, making music for humanity, not for people, allowed him to do revolutionary things, love to see how his deafness only took away from his ability to play, but not his love for music and desire to make musicㅇpersisted through whatever was going through his life, whether it was romantic failures, physical ailments, of which he was full of, his love for music persisted, and I feel a connection to him in that way. A passion for music, and an innovative mind that created revolutionary pieces sometimes only to be understood years after the initial premiers of the ___, speaker referred to some the audiences as “respectful confusion”. 

Talk ab the way he used themes,  development, climax, 

A night of reverence and awe of the life and the mind that Bweethoven held. Props to the speaker, love lliseting to the ways that people like him speak ab music - its clear the nuancedwunderstandings they hold of the composers, and loved to see his strong options of the way beethoven be performed come when questions came at the end, 
Also clear the passion they hold, reverence for the music, informed appreciation for music and composer behind it, seek to achieve that level of understanding at some point. 
So easy to see an almost childlike oobsession they hold for music, the history behind it, aspire to be like that in the future, aspire to bring that same passion for music to younger audiences,  sa Professor Ian Swenson
Always regarded some beethboens symphonies to br overplayed, lines that had lost they appeal, helped me discover the true, unbridled emotions that Beethoven was able to convey through his music, will be going through his music, discovering chamber music tat I’d written off as __, 
Unmatched builds, really high climaxes, loved listening to those, the type of climaxes I’d been seeking

Oh also respect he novelty in his compositions, refusal to recycle material, determination to bring new ideas to each type of composition, like someone (Haydn mentor, who felt rivalry with? Always find fascinating the ways that genius have such interesting personalitiesjust
