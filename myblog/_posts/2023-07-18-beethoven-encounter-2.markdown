Fascinating dive into the history of quartets that spanned their life from the birth and mastery of the form under Haydn, and its development from Beethoven. It tracked not only the impact of composers on the art form, but the mark that quartets left on it, as the form graduated from its initial informal settings with the help of Schuppanzigh, whose ushered in an era of professional string quartets with the first ever subscription series of performances of Beethoven’s quartets. His prowess at the violin and dedication to Beethoven allowed for Beethoven to push the envelope with his compositions, with ever more sophisticated and difficult pieces. He was paramount to Beethoven’s ability to write for the advancement?? of humanity, contrasting traditions of its day. [mozart, everyone else writing for the time, for friends to play, ofr students, to enjoy music in smaller settings, beethoven look towards the future, consciously writing music he knew might be received poorly, but would be understood in the years to come.

Tracked also the way the quartets were performed, from quartet to quartet, as time passed, how did the people plpauig it change, how might the ideas have changed as well.
How lines of pedagogy developed, how styles of playing passed from generation to generation, how Beethoven’s influence continued witth many. 



Haydn perfect ,Mozart inspired, both respected each other, Mozart death, beethoven instead a year later, Hadyn exits the string quartet writing world as beethoven takes over w rebolutionary quartets,
Schubert inspired by him, masterpiece written at same time as no 15? 

Schuppanzigh worked with Joseph Joachim, who works w Busch
Long line of violinists that worked to pass down Beethoven’s ideas, keep his ideas alive in the music that was played. Loved to hear b diff quartets, love hearing the differences feel that truly able to realize what my taste is, Guarneri
